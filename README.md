# TypeScript Todo App
This is a Todo App programmed in Typescript. It is only made for training.
It is planned to publish it on my Raspberry pi and to interact with proxy from everywhere of the world.
A php backend with login/auth is also planned.
!**mobile adjustments are planned and in progress**!

### How does this app works?
If you want to add a task you have to write the Task summary in the left input field and when you want to have this task done in the right input  field.
When this has be done you can click on the "Add"-Button and the Task appears in the list under the Input fields.
If a task is done you can check the box or delete it, then it will be deleted from the list.

- php login/auth
